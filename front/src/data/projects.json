    "description": "The Spirit Mod is one of the largest mods for Terraria: with more than 1300 items, 8 bosses, and hundreds of enemies, as well as 3 new events and 3 brand new biomes, the mod has a lot to offer. <br /> I had the privilege of contributing some system code, mainly the \"Stargoop\" system."
